# Pneumonia Detection using X-ray Images  

## 📖 Overview  
This project focuses on detecting **pneumonia from chest X-ray images** using **Deep Learning (CNNs)**.  
It leverages image preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to classify X-rays as **Pneumonia** or **Normal**.  
The goal is to assist healthcare professionals with **faster and more reliable diagnosis**.

## 📂 Dataset  
- Publicly available **Chest X-ray dataset** (commonly used: [Kaggle Pneumonia Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)).  
- Dataset contains two categories:  
  - **Pneumonia**  
  - **Normal**
